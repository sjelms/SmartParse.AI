**Tips for Effective Label Use:**

* **Start Simple:** You don't need to use every label from day one. Start with the most relevant ones and expand as needed.
* **Consistency is Key:** Try to apply labels consistently to new files.
* **Search and Smart Folders:** The real power of labels comes when you use macOS's search (Spotlight or Finder) and Smart Folders. You can create Smart Folders that automatically collect files with specific labels (e.g., "All Academic Papers," "Invoices - Action Required").
* **Color Coding (Optional):** macOS also allows you to assign colors to tags. You could use this for quick visual identification (e.g., red for "Action Required," green for "Final").
* **Review and Refine:** Periodically review your labels. Are they still serving your needs? Do you need to add, remove, or combine any?
* **Don't Over-Label:** While detailed, avoid adding too many labels to a single file if it doesn't genuinely aid in organization or retrieval.
